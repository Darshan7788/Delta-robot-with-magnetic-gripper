## Description of Materials

The materials used in this project are essential for the integrity and functionality of the Delta Robot. The materials are categorized into two main sections: the designed structure of the robot and the control part.

### Robot Structure and Material

| **Robot Part**    | **Material**         |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Fixed Part        | Wood (Laser Cutting) |
| Upper Base        | Wood (Laser Cutting) |
| Arms              | PLA (3D Printing)    |
| Joints            | PLA (3D Printing)    |
| Conveyor Belt     | Rexene               |
| Conveyor Body     | Acrylic (Laser Cutting) |
| Gripper           | Magnetic             |

The structure of the robot is made from carbon, metal rods, and plastic, with several parts being 3D printed to ensure precision and durability. The magnetic gripper is designed to handle ferromagnetic materials efficiently.
